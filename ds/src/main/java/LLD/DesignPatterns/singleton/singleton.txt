Singleton Design pattern:

We should have single instance of the class.

1- Constructor should be private
2- Public method for returning instance
3- Instance type- private static

Initialization type:

1- Eager initialization
2- Lazy initialization
3- Thread safe method initialization
4- Thread safe block initialization
