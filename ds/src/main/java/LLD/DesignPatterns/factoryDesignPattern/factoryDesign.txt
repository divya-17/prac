Factory Design Pattern

Properties:
----------
1- Used when we have multiple sub classes of a super class and based on the input we want to return one instance/
2- Provide abstraction b/w actual actual impl and client classes.
3- Remove instantiation of client classes from client code.

Impl
----

1- Super class can be an abstract class, an interface or a basic class
2- Factory class will have a static method that will return the instance of these sub classes
