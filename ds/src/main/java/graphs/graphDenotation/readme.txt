There are two ways to represent a graph:

1- Adjacency matrix
2- Adjacency list

Adjacency matrix is good for dense graphs where most of the nodes are connected to each other
because we will have very less 0s in the matrix in that case.

Ajacency list is good for sparse graphs, as creating matrix in such cases would have too many 0s.
